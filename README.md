## About The Project

## Gallery

Build a website for up and coming artists/photographers to advertise their products.

### Testing

The system should include at least five items for sale from each of the artist accounts listed below.
You are required to create the following accounts to allow the system to be tested. All accounts have the password p455w0rd:

1. artist1
2. artist2
3. buyer1
4. buyer2

### Stage 1
The core functionality consists of three screens.
#### Part 1
The home page should be viewable without needing to be logged in and should display all the items that all the artists 
want to sell arranged with the most recent at the top. Each should have:
1.	The name of the item
2.	A thumbnail image
3.	The price the seller is asking for
4.	A status, one of the following: 
1.	for sale.
2.	under offer.
3.	sold.
5.	The name and phone number of the artist.


### Extras

In some assignment briefs you are given marks for the appropriate use of media and using sensors built into the user's device.

**Sensors**

- When adding a new item to the gallery, the user should be given the option to capture the image using the device camera (if available).
